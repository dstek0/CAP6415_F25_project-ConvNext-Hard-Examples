                    WEEK 1 DEVELOPMENT LOG
                        (Nov 2-9, 2025)
=============================================================================

Project: Probing ConvNext SOTA Model with Hard Examples
Student: Dylan Stechmann
Course: CAP6415 - Computer Vision, Fall 2025

=============================================================================
What I Got Done This Week:
=============================================================================

1. FIGURING OUT THE PROJECT APPROACH
   
   After looking at different SOTA models I decided to go
   with ConvNext-Base which is from 2022 and modern.
   
   For the hard examples strategy, I'm planning to hit it from multiple angles:
   - Adversarial attacks (starting with FGSM/PGD, maybe Auto-Attack later)
   - Out-of-distribution scenarios 
   - Corner cases like texture-only images or weird lighting
   - Fine-grained classification where classes look similar
   - Multi-object confusion
   
   The idea is to not just blindly attack it, but actually understand WHERE
   and WHY it fails. That's the interesting part.

2. GETTING THE ENVIRONMENT SET UP
   
   Spent some time getting everything installed and working:
   - PyTorch 2.7.1 with CUDA support (running in WSL2 container)
   - timm library for model zoo access
   - Jupyter Lab for interactive work
   - All the CV libraries: OpenCV, PIL, albumentations
   - Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (IBM's ART library)
   - Standard stuff: numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
   

3. REPO STRUCTURE
   
   Set up the GitHub repo structure locally:
   - notebooks/ for Jupyter experiments
   - scripts/ for reproducible Python code
   - results/plots/ and results/images/ for outputs
   - data/ for datasets (won't commit large files to git)
   
   Created a README that explains what I'm doing and why. Need to
   push this to GitHub tonight to meet the Week 1 deadline.

=============================================================================
Where I'm At:
=============================================================================

✓ Week 1 (Nov 2-9):  Repo setup, environment configured, model loaded
□ Week 2 (Nov 16):   Start generating adversarial examples
□ Week 3 (Nov 23):   Implement all attack strategies, begin analysis
□ Week 4 (Nov 30):   Compile results, visualizations
□ Week 5 (Dec 7):    Record demo video
Final submission: December 8 by 11:59 PM

=============================================================================
What's Next (Week 2):
=============================================================================

Now that setup is done, time to actually start breaking things:

1. Load the model and verify it works on some sample images
2. Get baseline accuracy on a subset of ImageNet validation set
3. Implement FGSM attack (simplest adversarial perturbation)
4. Generate a batch of adversarial examples
5. Start documenting what patterns I see in the failures
6. Maybe try PGD if time permits

Goal is to have at least 100-500 hard examples by end of week 2.

=============================================================================
Technical Notes & Decisions:
=============================================================================

Environment:
- Running PyTorch 2.7.1 with CUDA support in WSL2
- If GPU isn't accessible, PyTorch has optimized CPU kernels (MKLDNN)
- Using Jupyter Lab for exploratory work, will convert to scripts later

Dataset strategy:
- Full ImageNet validation set is ~50K images, probably overkill
- Starting with 1K-5K subset to keep experiments manageable
- Can scale up if I need more data for statistical significance

Attack approach:
- Starting simple with FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)
- Will add PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) next
- More advanced attacks (C&W, Auto-Attack) if time permits
- Also want to try non-adversarial approaches: style transfer, synthetic images

Deliverables Checklist:
=============================================================================

Development Log (10%):     [■□□□□] 1/5 weeks complete
Description/README (10%):  [■■■■□] Good draft, needs polish
Code Documentation (20%):  [■□□□□] Started, need more comments
Reproducibility (30%):     [■□□□□] Basic notebook working
Video Demo (30%):          [□□□□□] Not started yet

=============================================================================
Challenges This Week:
=============================================================================

- Docker container, dependencies, gpu passthrough
  
- ImageNet is huge. Need to be strategic about what subset to use. Thinking
  I'll focus on categories that are known to be confusing (similar classes
  like different dog breeds, or texture-heavy categories).
  
- Need to make sure everything is reproducible. The TA needs to be able to
  run this, so requirements.txt and clear instructions are crucial.
